# Password Generator


#### By Zach Hanson 
in collaboration with UTSA

#### Purpose
This application randomly generates passwords by prompting the user if they want to use numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, or lowercase letters. The goal is to create a password that is more secure and harder for hackers to guess. This application uses HTML for the structure, CSS to style the content, and Javascript acts as the engine running the functionality of the website.
